## Beginner Level

These test your understanding of scalability, availability, and basic system components.

Design a URL Shortener (like bit.ly)
→ Topics: hash functions, databases, cache, unique ID generation

Design a Rate Limiter
→ Topics: token bucket, sliding window, Redis, API gateway

Design a Key-Value Store (like Redis)
→ Topics: data partitioning, replication, consistency models

Design a Notification System
→ Topics: message queues, push/pull, fan-out

Design a Cache System (like CDN or local cache)
→ Topics: LRU/LFU, cache invalidation, TTL

Design a Logging System
→ Topics: log aggregation, indexing, storage, querying


## Intermediate Level

These require designing moderately complex distributed systems.

## Infrastructure & Deep-Dive Topics

Sometimes interviews focus on specific building blocks.

Design a Distributed Cache
→ (e.g., Redis Cluster, Memcached)

Design a Distributed Locking Service
→ (e.g., using Zookeeper, Redis, or etcd)

Design a Load Balancer
→ Layer 4 vs. Layer 7, consistent hashing, health checks

Design a Distributed Job Scheduler (like Cron across multiple nodes)
→ Fault tolerance, deduplication, coordination

Design a Search Autocomplete System
→ Trie, prefix indexing, caching, ranking


## Bonus: Architecture Decision Topics

You may also be asked to explain trade-offs between:

SQL vs. NoSQL

Monolith vs. Microservices

Synchronous vs. Asynchronous communication

CAP Theorem and its implications

Event-driven vs. Request-driven architectures
